                <h4>The Hunter</h4>

                <p>There are two different versions of the Orion myth, depending on the identity of his parents. The
                    first
                    of these identifies the sea-god Neptune as Orion's father and the the great huntress Queen Euryale
                    of
                    the Amazons as his mother. Orion inherited her talent, and became the greatest hunter in the world.
                    Unfortunately for him, with his immense strength came an immense ego, and he boasted that he could
                    best
                    any animal on earth. In response to his vanity, a single small scorpion stung him and killed
                    him.</p>

                <p>Another version of the Orion myth states that he had no mother but was a gift to a pious peasant from
                    Jupiter,
                    Neptune, and Mercury.<span>"Orion supposedly was able to walk on water and had greater strength and stature than any
                other mortal. A skilled blacksmith, he fabricated a subterranean palace for Vulcan. He also walled in the coasts
                of Sicily against the encroaching sea and built a temple to the gods there" (Magee, 48).</span></p>
